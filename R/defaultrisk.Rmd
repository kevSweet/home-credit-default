The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that predicts the probability of default on home mortgages.

First there are a few required packages:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
Step One: Data Processing 

First, I took a look at some of the data and identify which columns contain data that is irrelevant. To start this project, I am only going to consider app_target data and credit bureau data. (application_train.csv and bureau.csv)

Lets take a look at how these two .csv files relate.

```{r}
setwd("../data")
app_target <- read.csv("../data/application_train.csv")
bureau <- read.csv("../data/bureau.csv")
print(tbl_df(bureau))
```
In order to merge bureau into app_target, I must summarise some of the features in bureau and then group by SK_ID_CURR (customer ID). 

```{r}

#stopped here. Need to normalize columns before merge into app_target
bureau <- bureau %>%
  group_by(SK_ID_CURR) %>%
  summarise(sum(CREDIT_DAY_OVERDUE), mean(AMOUNT_CREDIT_SUM),  )

app_target <- merge(app_target, tmp, by = "SK_ID_CURR")

# remove unneeded data
rm(bureau)

print(tbl_df(app_target))
```
Right off the bat, I can see that some of these columns are not going to be useful in prediction. I am going to remove the following columns for the following reasons:

NAME_INCOME_TYPE - would add many dimensions to convert multiple strings to multiple indicator variables.
NAME_HOUSING_TYPE - would add many dimensions to convert multiple strings to multiple indicator variables. 
FLAG_MOBIL - ALL 1s
OCCUPATION_TYPE - would add many dimensions to convert multiple strings to multiple indicator variables.
ORGANIZATION_TYPE- would add many dimensions to convert multiple strings to multiple indicator variables.
HOUSETYPE_MODE- would add many dimensions to convert multiple strings to multiple indicator variables. Also many missing datapoints
WALLSMATERIAL_MODE - would add many dimensions to convert multiple strings to multiple indicator variables. Also many missing datapoints
FLAG_DOCUMENT_2 - ALL 0s






Step Two: Feature Selection

There are many features to this data set, so the first thing I want to know is: 
Which features are heavily correlated to each other? First, I will be analyzing which continuous variables are the most correlated using Pearson correlation.
```{r}
app_target_onlycont <- select_if(app_target, is.numeric)
CORLATE <- cor(as.matrix(app_target_onlynumeric[,2]), as.matrix(app_target_onlynumeric[,-2]))
CORLATE[,order(CORLATE[1,])]

```

Step Three: Predictive Model Comparison



Step Four: Tweak?


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

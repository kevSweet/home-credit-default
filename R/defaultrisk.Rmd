The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that predicts the probability of 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
setwd("../data")
sample_submission <- read.csv("../data/sample_submission.csv")
app_test <- read.csv("../data/application_test.csv")
app_target <- read.csv("../data/application_train.csv")
app_target <- merge(app_target, read.csv("../data/bureau.csv"), by = "SK_ID_CURR")
app_target_onlynumeric <- select_if(app_target, is.numeric)
CORLATE <- cor(as.matrix(app_target_onlynumeric[,2]), as.matrix(app_target_onlynumeric[,-2]))

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
